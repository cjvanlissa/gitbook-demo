Caspar J. van Lissa 2020-03-26 Chapter 1 Prerequisites This GitBook is created in Rstudio, using the bookdown package. To get your system set up correctly, you have to install several software packages, and register on GitHub. You only have to perform these steps once, and the entire process should take approximately 1 hour if you start from scratch. In case some software is already installed on your system, you can skip related steps. Follow these steps in order: Install R from cloud.r-project.org Install Rstudio Desktop (Free) from rstudio.com Install Git from git-scm.com. Use the default, recommended settings. It is especially important to leave these settings selected: Git from the command line and also from third party software Use the OpenSSL library Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings Enable Git Credential Manager If you run into any trouble, a more comprehensive tutorial on installing Git is available at happygitwithr.com. Register on GitHub Go to github.com and click “Sign up”. Choose an “Individual”, “Free” plan. Request a free academic upgrade. This allows you to create private repositories, which are only visible to you and selected collaborators, and can be made public when your work is published. Connect Rstudio to Git and Github (for more support, see this Rstudio article, and this blog post) Open Rstudio, open the Tools menu, click Global Options, and click Git/SVN Verify that Enable version control interface for RStudio projects is selected Verify that Git executable: shows the location of git.exe. If it is missing, manually fix the location of the file. Click Create RSA Key. Do not enter a passphrase. Press Create. A window with some information will open, which you can close. Click View public key, and copy the entire text to the clipboard. Close Rstudio (it might offer to restart by itself; this is fine) Go to www.github.com Click your user icon, click Settings, and then select the SSH and GPG keys tab. Click New SSH key. Give it an arbitrary name (e.g., your computer ID), and paste the public key from your clipboard into the box labeled “Key”. Open Rstudio again (unless it restarted by itself) Install all required packages by running the following code in the Rstudio console. Be prepared for three contingencies: If you receive any error saying There is no package called XYZ, then run the code install.packages(\"XYZ\") If you are prompted to update packages, just press 3: None. Updating packages this way in an interactive session sometimes leads to errors, if the packages are loaded. If you see a pop-up dialog asking Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation?, click No. If this leads to errors, then please follow Step 3 from this online guide, and run install.packages(\"devtools\"). This will take a long time, but will allow you to install packages from source. Run the following code to install the required packages: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;) tinytex::install_tinytex() git2r::config(global = TRUE, user.name = &quot;your.name&quot;, user.email = &quot;your.email&quot;) That’s it! Everything should be installed and connected now. "],
["get-your-gitbook.html", "Chapter 2 Get your GitBook", " Chapter 2 Get your GitBook To get your GitBook, you should follow these steps: Go to https://github.com/cjvanlissa/gitbook-demo In the top right of the page, click Fork. This will copy my gitbook-demo repository to your GitHub account. My repository is now copied to your account. It is a template repository, which means that you can create a new repository based on this one. Create a new repository for your own GitBook. Create one for a course you’ve been wanting to update. In the top-right corner of the GitHub website, click the + icon, and select “New repository”: In the dialog, select the gitbook-demo as “Repository template”, and give the repository an appropriate name for your course. Then, press Create repository: Now, go back to Rstudio on your computer. In Rstudio, click File &gt; New Project. A dialog will open. If you set up Rstudio with Git correctly, the dialog should have an option to create a new project from Version control. Click it: In the next dialog window, you should copy the URL of the GitHub repository you created in Step 5, like so: Now, in Rstudio, you can open files for editing and create new files (explained in the next Chapter). Open files by clicking them in the Files editor (usually in the bottom right of Rstudio): After you make a change, it will show up in the Git tab (usually in the top right of Rstudio). You must Commit the change locally, and then Push the change to GitHub to update your repo. To Commit, select the file and click the Commit button. Write a short message to describe the changes you made, then click the Commit button again. Now, press Push to send your commits to GitHub. To render your book as a GitBook, you must “Build” it. In the top-right panel of Rstudio, you see a “Build” tab. In this tab, simply click the “Build Book” button to build your book. You should see a lot of rendering messages, until a window pops up with your brand new GitBook. If you get errors at this stage, you probably made a mistake in preparing your system (see the previous Chapter). Building the book generated a lot of new files in the ./docs directory. This directory contains the website files for your GitBook. Open the Git tab again, verify that the ./docs directory is listed, and Commit and Push all of these new files as described in Step 9. There is only one last remaining task: To publish your GitBook on GitHub pages. Once you do this, any change to the ./docs folder that you push to GitHub will lead to an immediate update of your GitBook website. Go back to the GitHub page for your Repository. Click on the Settings tab on the top right of the page: On the Settings page, scroll all the way down until you reach a section called GitHub Pages. There, under the “Source” heading, click the word None, and select master branch /docs folder. When you select it, the page will update, and if you scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section, you will see the URL where your GitBook is published. The first time, it will take a few minutes for your GitBook to come online. When you publish updates to the GitBook however (simply by following Step 11 again), the update will be near-instantaneous. The Pages section should now look like this (and that is hopefully the link where you found this book): "],
["editing-the-book.html", "Chapter 3 Editing the book 3.1 Creating new chapters 3.2 Linking across chapters 3.3 Advanced editing", " Chapter 3 Editing the book The contents of the book are written in RMarkdown. You can use any formatting code that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Moreover, you can include chunks of R-code, like this: ```{r} print(\"This is an R-command!\") ``` The results of these chunks can be rendered to the GitBook: ## [1] &quot;This is an R-command!&quot; To edit the book, you can change the text in the .Rmd files. Each Rmd file should contain one and only one chapter. A chapter is defined by the first-level heading #, e.g., # Editing the book. Any sub-headings within the chapter are indicated with several # signs, e.g., ## (level 2) and ### (level 3). 3.1 Creating new chapters To create a new chapter, you must follow two steps: 1) Create the file, and 2) Include it in the list of chapters. First, to create the file for a new chapter in Rstudio, click File &gt; New File &gt; Text file. At the top of the file, write your chapter heading, as explained above. Then, click File &gt; Save. Save the file as .Rmd, without spaces in the file name, e.g.: editing_the_book.Rmd. Second, to include it in the list of chapters, open the file _bookdown.yml (click it in the Files explorer in the bottom right of Rstudio). This file has a list of .Rmd files to be included in the book. In this example, the list looks like this: tmp &lt;- readLines(&quot;_bookdown.yml&quot;) cat(tmp[grep(&quot;^rmd_files&quot;, tmp):grep(&quot;references\\\\.Rmd&quot;, tmp)], sep = &quot;\\n&quot;) rmd_files: [“index.Rmd”, “get_your_gitbook.Rmd”, “editing_the_book.Rmd”, “figures_tables.Rmd”, “examples.Rmd”, “licenses.Rmd”, “references.Rmd”] Insert the file name of your new chapter in the desired position in this list. 3.2 Linking across chapters You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them. The labels can be used as cross-references. For example, we can link to Chapter 4. If you do not manually label chapters, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. 3.3 Advanced editing The convenient Rmarkdown Cheat Sheet by Rstudio covers most of the knowledge required for advanced Rmarkdown editing. You can print it out and stick it to your wall! "],
